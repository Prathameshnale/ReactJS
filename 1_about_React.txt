JavaScript Points must know for ReactJS -
1. let, var, const, functions, arrow functions, import and export (modules)



import - when we want to access any function, property or data from another file then we need used 
         import keyword. as we use import then only the data which was exported will be import in that file.

        e.g  (so here we want to import emp object from employee.js file into app.js file)

        file name - employee.js

        export let emp = {
            name : "prathamesh"
        }

        export let age=100;


        file name - app.js
        //there are many ways to import that object
        1. import { emp } from './employee.js';
        2. import { age } form './employee.js';
        3. import { emp as e1 } from './employee.js';  (e1 is a anonymous name for emp we must use only e1 in app.js)
        4. import * as EmpObj from './employee.js'; (this syntax used to access everything which was exported 
                                                    from employee.js at the same time but while use we should 
                                                    use it with EmpObj.emp like this,here EmpOjb is act as object
                                                    of emplyee file)
        5. import { emp, age } from '/emplyee.js'; (for acessing multiple data at the same time)


export - when we want to send any data to another file then we need to use export keyword.

AS we can see in above employee.js file we want to export the emp object and let variable we want to export
so for that we write the keyword export at the begining.



default export -

    file name - employee.js

        export let emp = {
            name : "prathamesh"
        }

        let age=100;

        export default age;  //in any single file we can use export data defualt only one time 
                             //it can be only data like object,variable but only once in sigle file
        
    
    file name - app.js

        1. import age from './employee.js';  //this is how we can directly import default data with same name.

        2. import a from './employee.js';  //this is how we can directly import dafault data with another name.
